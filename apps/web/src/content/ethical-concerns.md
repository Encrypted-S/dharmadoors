# Choosing a Safe Sangha

SanghaMap aims to help you find a Buddhist community where you can practice safely. While the vast majority of Buddhist centers are led by sincere, ethical teachers, there have been documented cases of harm in some organizations.

## Our Approach

We believe in **transparency, not censorship**:

- **All centers are listed** - we don't exclude anyone
- **Centers with documented concerns** are hidden by default
- **You can opt-in** to see these centers if you choose
- **We link to sources** so you can research and decide for yourself

## What We Mean by "Documented Concerns"

We flag organizations only when there is:

1. **Published journalism** from reputable outlets (NYT, Guardian, Lion's Roar)
2. **Independent investigations** commissioned by the organizations themselves
3. **Legal findings** (court cases, settlements)
4. **Open letters** signed by senior students or former members

We do **not** flag based on:

- Anonymous allegations
- Social media rumors
- Theological disagreements
- Personal conflicts

## Currently Flagged Organizations

The following organizations have documented ethical concerns. This does not mean all their centers are unsafe, or that you shouldn't practice with them - many wonderful practitioners are part of these communities. It means you should be informed before joining.

### Shambhala International

**Concern:** Sexual misconduct by Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche

**What happened:** In 2018-2019, Buddhist Project Sunshine released reports documenting allegations of sexual assault and misconduct by the leader. Multiple women came forward with accounts spanning decades.

**Current status:** Sakyong stepped back from teaching. The organization has undergone leadership changes and implemented safeguarding policies.

## Red Flags to Watch For

Regardless of affiliation, here are warning signs to be aware of when evaluating any spiritual community:

### Teacher Behavior
- Claims of special powers or enlightenment that cannot be questioned
- Sexual relationships with students
- Financial exploitation or pressure for donations
- Isolation from family or other communities
- Discouraging questions or critical thinking

### Organizational Culture
- "Us vs. them" mentality
- Secrecy around practices or finances
- Rapid escalation of commitment expected
- Shaming or punishment for doubt
- Claims that leaving will cause spiritual harm

### Healthy Signs
- Transparency about finances and governance
- Clear ethical guidelines and accountability structures
- Encouragement of questions and healthy skepticism
- Respect for boundaries and consent
- Connection with broader Buddhist community
