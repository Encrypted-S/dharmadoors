# Choosing a Safe Sangha

SanghaMap aims to help you find a Buddhist community where you can practice safely. While the vast majority of Buddhist centers are led by sincere, ethical teachers, there have been documented cases of harm in some organizations.

## Our Approach

We believe in **transparency, not censorship**:

- **All centers are listed** - we don't exclude anyone
- **Centers with documented concerns** are hidden by default
- **You can opt-in** to see these centers if you choose
- **We link to sources** so you can research and decide for yourself

## What We Mean by "Documented Concerns"

We flag organizations only when there is:

1. **Published journalism** from reputable outlets (NYT, Guardian, Lion's Roar)
2. **Independent investigations** commissioned by the organizations themselves
3. **Legal findings** (court cases, settlements)
4. **Open letters** signed by senior students or former members

We do **not** flag based on:

- Anonymous allegations
- Social media rumors
- Theological disagreements
- Personal conflicts

## Currently Flagged Organizations

The following organizations have documented ethical concerns. This does not mean all their centers are unsafe, or that you shouldn't practice with them - many wonderful practitioners are part of these communities. It means you should be informed before joining.

### Shambhala International

**Concern:** Sexual misconduct by Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche

**What happened:** In 2018-2019, Buddhist Project Sunshine released reports documenting allegations of sexual assault and misconduct by the leader. Multiple women came forward with accounts spanning decades.

**Current status:** Sakyong stepped back from teaching. The organization has undergone leadership changes and implemented safeguarding policies.

## Groups That Are Not Buddhism

Some groups use Buddhist terminology or imagery but are not recognized as Buddhist traditions by mainstream Buddhist federations. These are listed separately because:

1. **They may explicitly say they're not Buddhism** (e.g., Falun Gong)
2. **They've been rejected by Buddhist authorities** (e.g., True Buddha School)
3. **They're syncretic religions** that mix Buddhism with other traditions

This is not a judgment on individual practitioners. If you're specifically looking for Buddhist practice, these groups may not be what you're seeking. If you're interested in them for their own merits, that's a personal choice.

### Falun Gong (Falun Dafa)

**Status:** Not Buddhism

**What it is:** A spiritual practice founded by Li Hongzhi in 1992 in China, combining qigong exercises with moral teachings. Li Hongzhi has explicitly stated that Falun Gong is not Buddhism.

**Why it's listed separately:** Falun Gong itself does not claim to be Buddhism, despite using some Buddhist terminology and imagery.

### Supreme Master Ching Hai

**Status:** Not Buddhism

**What it is:** A syncretic new religious movement founded by Ching Hai (born Hue Dang Trinh) that combines elements of Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and other traditions. Known for the Quan Yin Method of meditation and the Loving Hut vegan restaurant chain.

**Why it's listed separately:** Not recognized as a Buddhist tradition by Buddhist federations. The organization's teachings deviate significantly from established Buddhist schools.

### True Buddha School

**Status:** Not Buddhism

**What it is:** A religious movement founded by Lu Sheng-yen (盧勝彥) in Taiwan in 1982. Lu claims to be a living Buddha and has developed an elaborate spiritual cosmology.

**Why it's listed separately:** Rejected by major Buddhist federations including the Buddhist Association of the Republic of China. Lu's claims of Buddhahood are not accepted by established Buddhist authorities.

### Happy Science (幸福の科学)

**Status:** Not Buddhism

**What it is:** A Japanese new religious movement founded by Ryuho Okawa in 1986. Okawa claims to be the incarnation of El Cantare, a supreme being, and also the reincarnation of the Buddha, Jesus, and other religious figures.

**Why it's listed separately:** While incorporating Buddhist concepts, Happy Science's claims about Okawa's divine status place it outside recognized Buddhist traditions.

### I-Kuan Tao (一貫道)

**Status:** Not Buddhism (Syncretic Religion)

**What it is:** A Chinese religious movement that emerged in the early 20th century, combining elements of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. It has its own distinct practices and hierarchy.

**Why it's listed separately:** While I-Kuan Tao respects Buddhist elements, it is a distinct syncretic religion with its own theological framework, not a school of Buddhism.

## Red Flags to Watch For

Regardless of affiliation, here are warning signs to be aware of when evaluating any spiritual community:

### Teacher Behavior
- Claims of special powers or enlightenment that cannot be questioned
- Sexual relationships with students
- Financial exploitation or pressure for donations
